Abstract: Benthic–pelagic coupling, the reciprocal exchange of materials between benthic and pelagic habitats, has traditionally emphasized pelagic influences on benthic systems. Yet, the role of benthic biological processes in shaping pelagic microbial dynamics remains underexplored. We investigated how surfgrass and mussels regulate nitrogen and dissolved organic matter (DOM) cycling and their cascading effects on heterotrophic bacteria in Oregon tide pools. We quantified biogeochemical fluxes and bacterial responses before and after foundation species removal during contrasting upwelling regimes. Mussel-dominated pools released high concentrations of ammonium and nitrate, while surfgrass pools transformed DOM that fueled bacterial growth; upwelling intensified these benthic-pelagic linkages. Removing foundation species dampened nutrient release in mussel pools and reduced DOM-fueled bacterial growth in surfgrass pools ultimately decoupling benthic productivity from pelagic microbial growth. Our results demonstrate the critical role of foundation species to pelagic microbial processes and underscore the vulnerability of coastal microbial dynamics to their global decline.
